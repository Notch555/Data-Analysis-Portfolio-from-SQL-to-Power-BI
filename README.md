# Data-Analysis-Portfolio-from-SQL-to-Power-BI
## Client Demand:
We need to improve our internet sales report and we want to move from static reports to cisual dashboards.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been overtime.
seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be benefitial to be able to filter them also.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.
The budget is for 2021 and we actually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
Let me know if you need anything else.

## Data Source:
The data used in this project were all gotten from the Adventure work sample database in SQL Server management system.

### Enjoy
